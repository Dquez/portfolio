One of the problems I've already encountered is that computer programming is not a spectator sport. I'm familiar with this notion because neither was my undergraduate degree as an Italian major. Both skills require thorough practice and use of the ins and outs of the fundamental and complex parts. I tend to study the rules and best practices hoping they'll be engrained in my head for when I actually start coding. But friends have told me that even if I fail trying, it's better than not trying at all. I intend on fixing this passive mentality by setting aside about 2 hours each day during the week to code, using a pomodoro clock or iPhone timer to keep me in check. Once I start, I'll try to keep the Seinfeld effect in mind and not break the chain. If I do, I'll make sure not to fail twice.
